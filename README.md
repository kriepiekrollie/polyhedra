# explore the platonic solids?

This is my way of learning webGL and react i guess.

## goals:

- I hope to add more shapes!!!!
Maybe all the archimedean solids and the catalan solids? They are super duper cool imo.

- I want to make this into an interactive and pretty website (not just a floating shape).

- To have fun :)

## If you want to run this on your computer?

clone it and run `npm install` and then `npm start` yay
